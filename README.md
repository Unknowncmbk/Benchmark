# Benchmark
A simple C++ program that performs a disk benchmark.

## Introduction to Benchmark
Benchmark is a simple C++ program that performs a disk benchmark.

## Background
We don't know what hard drives to buy! - We have a series of hard drives that we are considering
for installation into our file servers. Write a simple pogram in C++ that performs a simple
disk benchmark.

## Snapshots
Below is a screenshot of csa2.bu.edu, Boston University's Computer Science's main Linux computer, running 100 files of 1MB in size.
